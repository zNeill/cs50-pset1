# What does it do?

Enter a height value integer (such as 3) and mario.c will print a mario pyramid to the console. It's so elaborate, trying to inmitate the formatting in this github readme file is actually proving to be a challenge. That said, if you were to go ahead and compile this program, you might be just a tad underwhelmed.

This was my first dive into coding in C. Nothing super impressive here, unless you're really impressed by basic flow controls (for, while, conditional logic).
