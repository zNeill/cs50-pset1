Enter a height value integer (such as 3) and mario.c will print a mario pyramid to the console, like this:<br>
  # #<br>
 ## ##<br>
### ###<br>

This was my first dive into coding in C. Nothing super impressive here, unless you're really impressed by basic flow controls (for, while, conditional logic).
